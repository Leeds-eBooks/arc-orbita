      September 5 - 11, 2013, Rīga

      The mobile pirate radio station Marx FM was located in the attic of a five-storey building in the very center of Rīga, the building of the annual exhibition of the Contemporary Art Center “Survival Kit”, and broadcast poetry readings at 104.8 MHz FM. The station operated simultaneously online.

      The station continued for 7 days and was closed by the “Ether Police” - the “Electronic Communications Office of Latvia” – on an urgent request. Later, the “pirates” were sentenced to 150 lats, which the Latvian Centre for Contemporary Art kindly helped to cover.

      Four storytellers, marked on the screen with color, vying with each other, collect the same story. As soon as one story overlaps with the speech of another narrator, the program gives the floor to him. The narrative lapses, endlessly joining together the most unexpected fragments to create a patchwork novella.

      Radio Wall at Cēsis Art Festival 2012

      **Аuthors:** Artur Punte, Sergej Timofejev, Eugene Sysoev, Vladimir Svetlov, Semjon Hanin

      Orbita had been experimenting with radio waves and FM-transmitters for two years in their performances; the concept of the Radio Wall was first presented to a wider audience as part of the ‘FM Slow Show: Poetic Meditation in Radio Waves and City Noises’. During the performance, five poets read their works accompanied by a background of city noises recorded during their travels to different European cities. The recorded noises are transmitted by FM radio waves, received and played back during the performance with the help of small portable radio sets. The subject – radio, message and media noise – is also elaborated by Orbita in their Radiowall installation, created especially for the Cēsis Art Festival. It is specially designed and constructed 10-metre long and 2-metre tall wall featuring numerous built-in radio receivers of various sizes and strength, tuned to different FM frequencies. The radio sets broadcast specially compiled collages of poetry and music which will were recorded and treated during the preparation stage of the project. The Radio Wall installation invites the visitors to enjoy the work of art at their leisure; people are able to spend an unlimited amount of time exploring it – moving on unhurriedly, metre after metre, radio channel after radio channel, until they find something that speaks to them personally, be it a poem, a melody or the sounds of a storm outside the window in a small Lithuanian town or perhaps in Helsinki.

      Automatic ticket printer, software, uncontrollable space probe

      An unusual property of this automatic printer has been discovered: when connected to power, it starts to print out a series of statements that, as it turns out after a scrupulous analysis of the text, are most likely messages from a first-generation space probe, all contact with which has been lost for a long time. The messages are essentially descriptions of the spacescape and various interpretations thereof. You can receive a ticket in one of the four languages of operation and find out what the probe sees and describes at the specific moment.

      _External photo: Hans Jakobsson [@hjakse](https://twitter.com/hjakse)_

      The secret Soviet state police, the KGB, moved into this house in 1940 when the Soviet Union occupied Latvia for the first time and again in 1944. They left the building in 1991 after Latvia’s independence.

      A prison was established in the basement with 14 cells. The house was located on the corner of Lenin and Friedrich Engels Streets (the Soviet names), hence the name “The Corner House”.

      During the period of the Soviet dictator, Stalin, and especially during the years occupation in 1940-41 people were tortured and interrogated on the sixth floor and executed in the basement (the shower room) or the yard. Thousands of people were sent to Gulag hard labor camps for decades, after being interrogated in the house.

      **Orbita** presented a poetry installation in former KGB building, dedicated to unrealized and impossible dreams of escape.

      The Twinkling Crystal Of Revelation
      LED-fans with programmed text
      2015

      “The work was first realized in Jurmala for the Dubulti art station – in a summer resort where crowds of tourists roam. We wanted to create a place where you can breathe in the wind, hear the noise and rustle of dozens of fans and read the words in the air. Fans with LED elements create text that looms, makes noise and pushes at you. And which is constantly changing, putting words into different elementary sentence structures. In part, this work is based on mystical revelations, which traditionally appear both in the air and in the traditions of the oracles, always reporting their news in an extremely metaphorical form. The structure of the proposal itself was based on the general name of the exhibition, in which we participated: ‘My heart is a tiger.’”

      The installation is made up of small light diode screens. What is being portrayed can be understood if the viewer steps back, or by looking at the reflected image on the screen, which is reflected onto another specially prepared surface. The diodes can be perceived as the provider of the signal and the reflected image as a confirmation of receiving the signal.
